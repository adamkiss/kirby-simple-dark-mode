# Kirby Pluginkit: Example plugin for Kirby

ðŸš§ Warning! This is a Work in progress.

This is just a filter dumped on the whole panel, with couple of nice things to make it "sort of/maybe" count as a real dark mode:

- images are inverted back and instead have lower opacity applied
- some panels are recolored, so the contrast is better/lower once inverted
- shadows are fixed so they aren't white
